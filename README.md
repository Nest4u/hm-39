# React: Stateful and Stateless Training

This project is a training exercise to practice building React components with different approaches:

- **Stateful Components**: Components that manage their own state.
- **Stateless Components**: Components that receive data and actions through props.

## Features

1. Add tasks to the list.
2. Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
3. Delete tasks from the list.
4. Separate tasks into "Completed" and "Uncompleted".
